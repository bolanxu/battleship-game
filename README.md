# battleship-game
This is interesting battleship game made on a radar screen. I made this in 2017 as my first challenging project using Proccessing in 3rd grade :) inspired by Ubisoft's game Silent Hunter. The goal of game was make the player feel as if he was controlling the battleship but only looking at the world through a sonar screen. This makes it so that the player has to estimate the position of where they will land after they move or fire. Overall, I learned a lot about vectors and transformations trying calculate the new positions for the ships on the screen.

## How to Play
Use the up and down arrow keys to change the speed or distance your dot or ship moves. Use the right and left arrow keys to change the direction your dot or ship turns to.
Press enter to move your ship or press backspace to fire from your ship based on the parameters set on the two dails.
There are two players and the goal is to hit the other player and win.
